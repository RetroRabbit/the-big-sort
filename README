The Big Sort


This repo contains the source for utilities around The Big Sort dev day.


Utility: generate

generates a file with random stuff.

    Usage: generate <amount in gigabytes>

The program will print to stdout so run it e.g. like this:

    # will generate 3Gb of random data and store in /tmp/wut.dat
    generate 3 > /tmp/wut.dat


(that's all for now)
